## 3.  Experiments
We tested the proposed PSF estimation framework on the Keck AO systems (Drummond & Christou 2009). Two groups of experiments were conducted to test the proposed method. The first one is referred to as PSF identification. In this experiment, we assume that each degraded image is blurred by a PSF from a set containing fixed kinds of PSFs, and we apply the networks to identify the PSF. The second experiment, which is much more challenging than the first one, is referred to as PSF prediction. In this experiment, we assume that each degraded image is blurred by a PSF from a set containing infinite kinds of PSFs. Thus, its PSF may be different from that of any other images. We apply the networks to predict the distribution of the PSF.
